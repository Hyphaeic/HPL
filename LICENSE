TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

This license is derived from the Apache License, Version 2.0, with
additional conditions set forth in Section 4. This is NOT an Apache
Software Foundation license.

PREAMBLE: THE NATURE OF THIS AGREEMENT This software is provided strictly for the advancement of open infrastructure and individual sovereignty. The Licensor declines monetary compensation in favor of a specific ethical exchange: You may use this Work only if You respect the digital rights of end-users. This ethical compliance is the sole and material consideration for this License. If You cannot pay this price, You have no right to the Work.

1. Definitions.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 5 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the
copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,
and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
notice that is included in or attached to the work.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to the
Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means
any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.

"Suppression Infrastructure" shall mean any system that restricts 
the transmission, display, or discoverability of lawful expression 
where such restriction fails ANY of the following requirements:

  (a) TRANSPARENCY: Each restriction must be accompanied by a 
      permanently accessible public record containing:
        (i) a cryptographic hash of the restricted content;
        (ii) the specific policy clause cited as justification; and
        (iii) a substantive explanation of how the specific content 
              violated that clause, sufficient for a reasonable 
              observer to independently evaluate the decision.
      A bare citation to a policy clause without substantive 
      explanation (e.g., "violated Policy 7.3") does not satisfy 
      this requirement.

  (b) ACCOUNTABILITY: The system must provide a dispute resolution 
      process and publish no less than quarterly:
        (i) the total number of restrictions applied;
        (ii) the number of restrictions reversed on dispute; and
        (iii) disaggregated data sufficient to detect asymmetric 
              enforcement patterns across viewpoints or speaker 
              categories.

  (c) NEUTRALITY: Restrictions must be applied uniformly without 
      regard to the identity, political affiliation, viewpoint, 
      or perceived status of the speaker. Identical or substantially 
      similar content must receive identical treatment regardless 
      of source. Patterns of selective enforcement against 
      disfavored viewpoints constitute asymmetric application 
      regardless of facial neutrality of stated policies.

For the avoidance of doubt: Restrictions on content that is unlawful 
in the affected user's jurisdiction do not implicate this definition, 
as such content is not "lawful expression." Restrictions based on 
categories such as "hate speech," "misinformation," or "harmful 
content" that extend beyond jurisdictionally illegal content 
constitute viewpoint-based restrictions subject to this definition.

"Surveillance Infrastructure" shall mean any system that targets
noncombatant populations and:
  (a) aggregates behavioral, biometric, or communications data on
      individuals without their explicit, informed, revocable consent
      for each distinct use case; or
  (b) enables the correlation of identity across contexts without user
      initiation; or
  (c) provides any government, law enforcement, or intelligence entity
      access to user data absent a public, individualized judicial
      order.

"Noncombatant" shall mean any individual not actively engaged in armed
conflict as a member of an organized armed force, consistent with the
principle of distinction under international humanitarian law. Civilian
populations, including citizens subject to domestic law enforcement,
are noncombatants. A state's unilateral classification of its own
civilian population as combatants does not alter their status as
noncombatants under this License.

"Law Enforcement Integration" shall mean any feature, API, data pipeline, or contractual arrangement designed to facilitate the automated export, mirroring, or real-time access of data to any system controlled by, or accessible to, a government entity, law enforcement agency, or intelligence service, whether domestic or foreign. This includes: 
  (a) "Backdoor" access keys or administrative privileges provided to state actors; 
  (b) Automated reporting tools that transmit user data absent a public, individualized judicial order; or 
  (c) Ingestion of data into predictive policing databases or fusion centers.

"Dominant Position" shall mean any Legal Entity that, together with entities under common control: (a) generates annual gross revenue exceeding one billion United States dollars ($1,000,000,000 USD) from communications, social networking, search, or information distribution services; or (b) operates a platform serving more than fifty million (50,000,000) monthly active users.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Conditions on Information Sovereignty.

4.1 Prohibited Uses.

This License does not grant rights to any Legal Entity that:
  (a) operates Suppression Infrastructure; or
  (b) operates Surveillance Infrastructure; or
  (c) provides material support, including but not limited to compute
      resources, API access, training data, hosting services, or
      integration services, to entities operating Suppression
      Infrastructure or Surveillance Infrastructure; or
  (d) holds a Dominant Position and implements any content restriction
      policy that is not:
        (i) strictly limited to content illegal in the jurisdiction of
            the affected user, and
        (ii) applied uniformly without regard to viewpoint.

4.2 Automatic Termination.

Violation of Section 4.1 terminates this License automatically and
retroactively ab initio. Upon such termination:
  (a) all rights granted hereunder are void as if never granted;
  (b) You shall immediately cease all use, distribution, and
      development of Derivative Works;
  (c) You acknowledge that monetary damages are inadequate remedy 
      and consent to injunctive relief without bond in any court 
      of competent jurisdiction.

Each party shall bear its own costs in any enforcement proceeding, 
regardless of outcome.

4.3 Verification of Compliance.

To ensure compliance with Section 4, You consent to reasonable 
verification measures upon a credible public allegation of violation.

Upon a prima facie showing of a Section 4 violation, You agree to:
  (a) Permit review by an independent technical auditor, selected 
      jointly by the parties, of relevant moderation logs and 
      policy enforcement records;
  (b) Waive any claim of trade secret regarding the existence or 
      error rates of moderation systems (but not source code);
  (c) Permit the auditor to publish a compliance determination.

Each party shall bear its own costs for verification activities, 
regardless of outcome. The auditor's fees shall be split equally 
unless the parties agree otherwise.

Refusal to cooperate with reasonable verification within sixty (60) 
days of a prima facie showing constitutes grounds for Licensor to 
seek injunctive relief and creates a rebuttable presumption of 
non-compliance.

4.4 Remedy and Specific Performance. You acknowledge that a breach of Section 4 causes irreparable harm to the Licensor’s moral rights and the integrity of the ecosystem, which cannot be compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 4, You agree that Licensor shall be entitled to Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief to compel compliance with Section 4.3 (Discovery and Audit) and to halt use of the Work, without the requirement of posting a bond. Licensor explicitly waives the right to seek monetary damages for breach of Section 4, electing solely for the remedies of transparency, termination, and public disclosure.

Licensor shall not be liable for any costs, fees, or damages arising from good-faith enforcement of this License, regardless of outcome
4.5 Safe Harbor.

Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(c) as applied to Suppression Infrastructure,
and Section 4.1(d) do not apply to Legal Entities that satisfy ALL of
the following conditions:
  (a) employ fewer than one hundred (100) individuals; and
  (b) generate less than fifty million United States dollars
      ($50,000,000 USD) in annual gross revenue; and
  (c) do not hold a Dominant Position.

Section 4.1(b) and Section 4.1(c) as applied to Surveillance
Infrastructure have NO safe harbor and apply regardless of entity size,
revenue, or market position.

4.6 Permitted Defense Applications.

Nothing in Section 4 shall be construed to prohibit use of the Work in:
  (a) defense systems, weapons platforms, or military applications
      targeting lawful combatants under international humanitarian law;
  (b) intelligence, reconnaissance, or surveillance systems directed at
      foreign military forces, hostile non-state armed groups, or
      individuals lawfully designated as combatants;
  (c) autonomous systems, including unmanned vehicles and weapons
      systems, where targeting is limited to lawful military objectives.

The permissions in this Section 4.6 EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE any system incorporating Law Enforcement Integration. For the avoidance of doubt: Individual self-defense is permitted; state-sponsored mass surveillance via Law Enforcement Integration is prohibited.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.

10. Essential Consideration and Indivisibility.

You acknowledge that Your agreement to the restrictions in Section 4 
constitutes the sole and material consideration for this License.

If Section 4 or any material portion thereof is held unenforceable, 
invalid, or unconscionable by a court of competent jurisdiction:
  (a) This License is void in its entirety due to failure of 
      consideration;
  (b) All rights previously granted terminate immediately;
  (c) Continued use of the Work constitutes copyright infringement.

Consistent with Section 12.4, Licensor waives the right to seek 
statutory or compensatory damages arising from post-termination use. 
Licensor's sole remedy is injunctive relief to halt unauthorized use.

11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

11.1 Choice of Law. This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business ("Licensor's Jurisdiction"), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

11.2 Venue. Any dispute arising from this License shall be adjudicated in the courts located within [ INSERT JURISDICTION HERE, e.g., King County, Washington ]. If no jurisdiction is specified in the Copyright Notice or attached NOTICE file, venue shall default to the federal or state courts located in the district where the Licensor resides.

11.3 Interpretation of Purpose. The Court is instructed to interpret this License with the understanding that the Licensor’s primary intent is the prevention of censorship and surveillance, not commercial gain. Ambiguities should be resolved in favor of preserving the integrity of the Information Sovereignty conditions set forth in Section 4.

12. Licensor Liability and Enforcement.

12.1 No Enforcement Obligation. Licensor is under no obligation to 
monitor for, investigate, or enforce violations of this License. 
Failure to enforce against any violation shall not constitute waiver 
of the right to enforce against the same or other violations.

12.2 Licensor Liability Cap. Licensor shall not be liable to any 
party for any costs, fees, damages, or expenses arising from:
  (a) Licensor's enforcement or attempted enforcement of this License;
  (b) Licensor's decision not to enforce this License;
  (c) Any third party's reliance on this License or compliance 
      determinations made hereunder;
  (d) Any verification or audit activities under Section 4.3.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor's total 
aggregate liability under this License shall not exceed zero dollars 
($0 USD).

12.3 Good Faith Standard. Enforcement actions under this License 
shall be conducted in good faith based on credible evidence of 
violation. This License does not authorize vexatious, frivolous, 
or bad-faith enforcement actions.

12.4 Exclusive Remedies. Licensor's sole remedies for breach of 
this License are:
  (a) Injunctive relief to halt unauthorized use;
  (b) License termination; and
  (c) Public disclosure of non-compliance.

Licensor explicitly and irrevocably waives all rights to monetary 
damages, statutory damages, attorneys' fees, costs, audit expenses, 
and any other pecuniary recovery for breach of this License.
