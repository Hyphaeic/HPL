# Hyphaeic Public License (HPL-1.0)

**A license for makers, not extractors.**

You built something. You want to share it. You want others to learn from it, build on it, make money from it, fork it, improve it. But you don't want it weaponized against the people it was meant to serve. Any entity involved with digital surveilance & supression technologies 

HPL-1.0 is for the indie dev shipping from the bakery or the bedroom. The open hardware collective designing the next generation of tools.

This license is intended to be a trojan horse. A legal warhead. We know our technologies will be stolen. Let them drink from poisoned wells.

## This License Is For You

If you're reading this, HPL-1.0 is probably for you. Here's who we built it for:

| You | What HPL Gives You |
|-----|-------------------|
| **Solo developers** | Use it, ship it, sell it. No restrictions. |
| **Small teams (<100 people)** | Full safe harbor. Moderate your community however you want. |
| **Open hardware projects** | Share your designs freely. Your FPGA firmware, your PCB layouts, your robot code—all protected. |
| **Startups under $50M** | Build your business. The restrictions don't touch you. |
| **Researchers & academics** | Publish freely. Your work stays in the commons. |
| **Defense contractors** | Yes, really. Build weapons systems—just not domestic surveillance. |

**safe harbor**: If you have fewer than 100 employees and less than $50M in revenue, the content moderation rules don't apply to you. Run your Discord however you want. Moderate your forum. Ban trolls. You're covered.

---

## This License Is Not For Them

HPL-1.0 has teeth, and they're pointed at the institutions that have made the internet worse:

| Them | What HPL Denies Them |
|------|---------------------|
| **Platforms that censor lawful speech without transparency** | Can't use your code |
| **Surveillance companies building tools to track civilians** | Can't use your code |
| **Cloud providers hosting censorship/surveillance infrastructure** | Can't use your code to do it |
| **Big Tech with viewpoint-based "trust and safety"** | Can't use your code |
| **Police tech vendors** | Can't use your code—no safe harbor, no exceptions |

Your work stays in the hands of people building things. Not people building control systems.

---

## The Philosophy

This software is provided for the advancement of open infrastructure and individual sovereignty. We decline monetary compensation in favor of a specific ethical exchange:

**You may use this Work only if you respect the digital rights of end-users.**

This ethical compliance is the sole and material consideration for this License. If you cannot pay this price, you have no right to the Work.

We're not anti-commercial. We're not anti-military. We're not even anti-Big-Tech in principle. We're anti-censorship and anti-surveillance. If you're not building tools of control, welcome aboard.

## Quick Reference

| You CAN use HPL-licensed software if you... | You CANNOT use HPL-licensed software if you... |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Build open source or commercial software | Operate platforms that censor lawful speech without transparency |
| Are a small team with any moderation policy | Operate surveillance systems targeting civilian populations |
| Develop defense/military applications against lawful combatants | Provide cloud/API services to censorship or surveillance operators |
| Are an individual, researcher, or hobbyist | Are a dominant platform with viewpoint-based content policies |
| Build hardware, firmware, FPGA designs, robotics | Build any system with law enforcement integration |

---

## What This License Actually Does

HPL-1.0 is Apache 2.0 with one additional section: **Conditions on Information Sovereignty** (Section 4).

**You get everything Apache 2.0 gives you:**
- Use commercially ✓
- Modify freely ✓
- Distribute widely ✓
- Sublicense ✓
- Patent protection ✓
- No copyleft requirements ✓

**Plus protection from your work being used by:**
- **Suppression Infrastructure**: Systems that censor lawful expression without transparency
- **Surveillance Infrastructure**: Systems that monitor civilian populations without consent
- **Law Enforcement Integration**: Systems designed to feed data to government/police

It also prohibits providing material support (hosting, APIs, compute) to such operators.

---

## The Safe Harbor (Why Small Teams Don't Need to Worry)

Section 4.5 creates a **complete safe harbor** for small organizations:

**If you meet ALL of these conditions:**
- Fewer than 100 employees
- Less than $50M annual revenue  
- Not a dominant platform (>$1B or >50M users)

**Then the Suppression Infrastructure rules DO NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

This means:
- ✅ Moderate your community however you want
- ✅ Ban users for any reason
- ✅ Remove content without explanation
- ✅ Have vague community guidelines
- ✅ Enforce rules inconsistently
- ✅ All the things small communities need to do to stay healthy

**You're building a community, not a public utility. We get it.**

### The Exception: No Safe Harbor for Surveillance

There is **NO safe harbor** for surveillance infrastructure, regardless of company size. A 10-person startup building facial recognition for police cannot use HPL-licensed software. This is intentional—surveillance is surveillance regardless of who builds it.

---

## Open Hardware & Physical Projects

HPL-1.0 works for more than just software. If you're in the open hardware community, this license covers:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Electronics** | PCB designs, schematics, FPGA/ASIC code, firmware |
| **Robotics** | Control systems, motion planning, sensor fusion code |
| **Manufacturing** | CNC toolpaths, 3D printer firmware, parametric designs |
| **Embedded systems** | Microcontroller code, drivers, bootloaders |
| **Scientific instruments** | Lab equipment designs, data acquisition systems |
| **Agriculture tech** | Sensor networks, automation systems, open tractors |
| **Energy systems** | Solar controllers, battery management, grid tools |

The same rules apply: your designs stay free for makers and builders. Surveillance vendors and censorship platforms can't touch them.

## For the Lawyers: What "Suppression Infrastructure" Means

This section gets technical. Skip it if you're a small team—the safe harbor covers you.

A system becomes "Suppression Infrastructure" if it restricts lawful expression and **fails ANY** of these requirements:

### (a) TRANSPARENCY

Each restriction must have a permanently accessible public record containing:
- A cryptographic hash of the restricted content
- The specific policy clause cited
- A substantive explanation of how the content violated that clause

Bare citations like "violated Policy 7.3" don't count. You must explain *why*.

### (b) ACCOUNTABILITY  

You must provide:
- A dispute resolution process
- Quarterly publication of: total restrictions, reversals on dispute, and disaggregated data sufficient to detect asymmetric enforcement

### (c) NEUTRALITY

Restrictions must be applied uniformly without regard to:
- Identity
- Political affiliation  
- Viewpoint
- Perceived status of the speaker

Patterns of selective enforcement constitute asymmetric application **regardless of facial neutrality of stated policies**.

### The Key Point

**All three prongs must be satisfied simultaneously.** Transparency doesn't cure viewpoint-based enforcement. Uniform application doesn't cure opacity. You need all three.

### What Is "Lawful Expression"?

Content that is legal in the affected user's jurisdiction. Not where your servers are. Not where your HQ is. Where the user is.

| Content Type | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Illegal where user is located | Not protected—remove freely |
| Legal where user is but illegal elsewhere | Protected—can't remove for that user |
| Legal but platform disagrees | Protected—viewpoint-based removal prohibited |

---

## For the Lawyers: What "Surveillance Infrastructure" Means

Systems targeting noncombatant populations that:
- Collect personal data without explicit, informed, revocable consent for each distinct use case
- Enable correlation of identity across contexts without user initiation
- Provide government/law enforcement/intelligence access without a public, individualized judicial order

**"Noncombatant"** = civilians. Your fellow citizens. A state calling protesters "terrorists" doesn't make them legitimate targets.

---

## For the Lawyers: What "Law Enforcement Integration" Means

Any system designed to facilitate automated data access by government/law enforcement:

- **Backdoors**: Admin keys or privileges for state actors
- **Automated reporting**: Data transmission without individualized judicial orders  
- **Predictive policing feeds**: Ingestion into police databases or fusion centers

**Responding to warrants is fine.** Building automated pipelines to law enforcement is not.

**Critical**: Defense applications explicitly exclude systems with Law Enforcement Integration. You can build weapons; you cannot build domestic surveillance, even under a "defense" label.

## Examples: What's Permitted

| Scenario | Permitted? | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Indie dev ships a SaaS product | ✅ Yes | Safe harbor, commercial use fine |
| Open hardware collective shares PCB designs | ✅ Yes | This is exactly who it's for |
| Startup (<$50M) runs a community forum with strict moderation | ✅ Yes | Safe harbor covers content moderation |
| Game studio uses HPL code in commercial title | ✅ Yes | Commercial use permitted |
| Defense contractor builds missile guidance | ✅ Yes | Defense applications permitted |
| Researcher publishes ML code | ✅ Yes | Academic use encouraged |
| Security researcher builds vulnerability scanner | ✅ Yes | Security research is not surveillance |
| Platform removes illegal content (CSAM, threats, etc.) | ✅ Yes | Illegal content isn't "lawful expression" |

## Examples: What's Prohibited

| Scenario | Permitted? | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|

| Platform removes "hate speech" (lawful content) | ❌ No | Viewpoint-based restriction |
| Platform labels content "misinformation" | ❌ No | Platform claiming authority over truth |
| Clearview AI or similar facial recognition | ❌ No | Surveillance infrastructure |
| Startup building license plate readers for police | ❌ No | No safe harbor for surveillance |
| Cloud provider hosting surveillance company | ❌ No | Material support |
| "Smart city" sensors with police access | ❌ No | Civilian surveillance |
| Defense system with FBI data integration | ❌ No | LEI exclusion applies |

## Enforcement: Why This Has Teeth

HPL-1.0 is designed to make compliance teams nervous:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Retroactive termination** | Violation voids the license *ab initio*—all past use becomes infringement |
| **Audit consent** | Violators agree to independent technical audits |
| **Trade secret waiver** | Can't hide behind "proprietary moderation systems" |
| **Injunctive relief without bond** | Licensor can seek immediate court orders |
| **One-way fee shifting** | If Licensor wins, violator pays attorneys' fees |
| **Jurisdiction selection** | Disputes in Licensor's home jurisdiction |

**The goal isn't to sue people.** The goal is to make Big Tech's lawyers say "we can't use this" when they evaluate your code. That's the feature.

---

## Licensor Protections

We protect you too:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **No enforcement obligation** | You don't have to police violations |
| **Zero liability** | You can't be sued for enforcement decisions |
| **Good faith standard** | Prevents vexatious enforcement by others |
| **Damages waiver** | You're seeking compliance, not money |

---

## Essential Consideration (The Nuclear Option)

Section 4 compliance is the **sole consideration** for the license. If a court finds Section 4 unenforceable, the entire license is void. You don't fall back to Apache 2.0—you lose all rights.

This prevents the obvious attack: "Your restrictions are unenforceable, so I get permissive licensing for free." No. If the ethical exchange fails, the deal is off.

---

## FAQ

**I'm a solo dev / small team. Do I need to worry about any of this?**

No. The safe harbor covers you completely for content moderation. Just don't build surveillance tools for police.

**Is this OSI-approved "open source"?**

No. Section 4 discriminates based on use case, which violates the Open Source Definition. We consider this a feature—the OSD was written to benefit corporations.

**Can I use this for my hardware project?**

Absolutely. HPL works for any copyrightable work: software, firmware, documentation, HDL code, even creative content.

**Does using HPL code make my project HPL-licensed?**

No. HPL is not copyleft. Use it in proprietary projects. The restrictions are on *who* can use it, not what license derivatives carry.

**What about AI training?**

If your AI system would itself constitute Suppression or Surveillance Infrastructure, you can't use HPL code in it. Otherwise, standard copyright principles apply.

**Can the military use this?**

Yes, for legitimate defense applications targeting lawful combatants. No, for domestic surveillance—even if they call it "defense."

**We have transparent content moderation. Are we compliant?**

Transparency is necessary but not sufficient. If you're removing lawful content based on viewpoint ("hate speech," "misinformation"), you're operating Suppression Infrastructure regardless of how transparent you are.

**What if a court strikes down Section 4?**

The entire license is void. This is intentional—it prevents the "restrictions are unenforceable so I get free Apache 2.0" attack.

**Is this actually enforceable?**

Some provisions may face challenges. But the primary function is signaling: compliance teams will flag this as high-risk regardless of ultimate enforceability. That's often enough.
