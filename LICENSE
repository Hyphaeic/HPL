This ethical compliance is the sole and material consideration for this License. If You cannot pay this price, You have no right to the Work.

1. Definitions.

"License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 5 of this document.

"Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the
copyright owner that is granting the License.

"Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control
with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management
of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii)
beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
including but not limited to software source code, documentation source,
and configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not
limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object
form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
notice that is included in or attached to the work.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to the
Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an
individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means
any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.

"Suppression Infrastructure" "Suppression Infrastructure" shall mean any system that restricts the transmission or display of content where such restriction is NOT accompanied by: 
  (a) A permanently accessible, public URL (or API endpoint) listing the cryptographic hash of the restricted content and the specific policy clause violated; AND 
  (b) A dispute resolution process with a published "Success Rate" metric updated quarterly.
Failure to implement these technical transparency measures constitutes the operation of Suppression Infrastructure, regardless of the intent or content of the moderation.

"Surveillance Infrastructure" shall mean any system that targets
noncombatant populations and:
  (a) aggregates behavioral, biometric, or communications data on
      individuals without their explicit, informed, revocable consent
      for each distinct use case; or
  (b) enables the correlation of identity across contexts without user
      initiation; or
  (c) provides any government, law enforcement, or intelligence entity
      access to user data absent a public, individualized judicial
      order.
Surveillance Infrastructure includes, without limitation: automated
license plate recognition systems shared with law enforcement; facial
recognition databases accessible to government entities for domestic
use; location tracking systems that aggregate civilian movement
patterns; communication metadata retention systems targeting domestic
populations; and sensor networks with law enforcement integration
deployed against noncombatants.

"Noncombatant" shall mean any individual not actively engaged in armed
conflict as a member of an organized armed force, consistent with the
principle of distinction under international humanitarian law. Civilian
populations, including citizens subject to domestic law enforcement,
are noncombatants. A state's unilateral classification of its own
civilian population as combatants does not alter their status as
noncombatants under this License.

"Law Enforcement Integration" shall mean any feature, API, data pipeline, or contractual arrangement designed to facilitate the automated export, mirroring, or real-time access of data to any system controlled by, or accessible to, a government entity, law enforcement agency, or intelligence service, whether domestic or foreign.

  (a) "Backdoor" access keys or administrative privileges provided to state actors; 
  (b) Automated reporting tools that transmit user data absent a public, individualized judicial order; or 
  (c) Ingestion of data into predictive policing databases or fusion centers.

"Dominant Position" shall mean any Legal Entity that, together with entities under common control: (a) generates annual gross revenue exceeding one billion United States dollars ($1,000,000,000 USD) from communications, social networking, search, or information distribution services; or (b) operates a platform serving more than fifty million (50,000,000) monthly active users.

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Conditions on Information Sovereignty.

4.1 Prohibited Uses.

This License does not grant rights to any Legal Entity that:
  (a) operates Suppression Infrastructure; or
  (b) operates Surveillance Infrastructure; or
  (c) provides material support, including but not limited to compute
      resources, API access, training data, hosting services, or
      integration services, to entities operating Suppression
      Infrastructure or Surveillance Infrastructure; or
  (d) holds a Dominant Position and implements any content restriction
      policy that is not:
        (i) strictly limited to content illegal in the jurisdiction of
            the affected user, and
        (ii) applied uniformly without regard to viewpoint.

4.2 Automatic Termination.

Violation of Section 4.1 terminates this License automatically and
retroactively ab initio. Upon such termination:
  (a) all rights granted hereunder are void as if never granted;
  (b) You shall immediately cease all use, distribution, and
      development of Derivative Works;
  (c) You acknowledge that monetary damages are inadequate remedy and
      consent to injunctive relief without bond in any court of
      competent jurisdiction;
  (d) You shall be liable for all enforcement costs including
      reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness costs.

4.3 Verification of Information Sovereignty. To ensure compliance with the crucial restrictions of Section 4, You grant Licensor the irrevocable right to designate an independent technical auditor to verify Your systems.

If a prima facie showing of a Section 4 violation is made (e.g., a credible public report of opaque censorship), You agree to: 
  (a) Provide the auditor read-only access to relevant moderation logs, training data metadata, and internal policy enforcement tickets; and 
  (b) Waive any claim of "Trade Secret" regarding the existence or error rates of your moderation algorithms (but not the source code thereof).

Refusal to submit to this audit within thirty (30) days of notice constitutes a material breach triggering Section 10 (Termination).

In the event that the independent auditor confirms a material breach of Section 4, or if You refuse to submit to the audit, You agree to bear all costs associated with the audit and any subsequent enforcement actions, including Licensor’s full legal fees on an indemnity basis."

4.4 Remedy and Specific Performance. You acknowledge that a breach of Section 4 causes irreparable harm to the Licensor’s moral rights and the integrity of the ecosystem, which cannot be compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 4, You agree that Licensor shall be entitled to Specific Performance and Injunctive Relief to compel compliance with Section 4.3 (Discovery and Audit) and to halt use of the Work, without the requirement of posting a bond. Licensor explicitly waives the right to seek monetary damages for breach of Section 4, electing solely for the remedies of transparency, termination, and public disclosure.

4.5 Safe Harbor.

Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(c) as applied to Suppression Infrastructure,
and Section 4.1(d) do not apply to Legal Entities that satisfy ALL of
the following conditions:
  (a) employ fewer than one hundred (100) individuals; and
  (b) generate less than fifty million United States dollars
      ($50,000,000 USD) in annual gross revenue; and
  (c) do not hold a Dominant Position.

Section 4.1(b) and Section 4.1(c) as applied to Surveillance
Infrastructure have NO safe harbor and apply regardless of entity size,
revenue, or market position.

4.6 Permitted Defense Applications.

Nothing in Section 4 shall be construed to prohibit use of the Work in:
  (a) defense systems, weapons platforms, or military applications
      targeting lawful combatants under international humanitarian law;
  (b) intelligence, reconnaissance, or surveillance systems directed at
      foreign military forces, hostile non-state armed groups, or
      individuals lawfully designated as combatants;
  (c) autonomous systems, including unmanned vehicles and weapons
      systems, where targeting is limited to lawful military objectives.

The permissions in this Section 4.6 EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE any system incorporating Law Enforcement Integration. For the avoidance of doubt: Individual self-defense is permitted; state-sponsored mass surveillance via Law Enforcement Integration is prohibited.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on
an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.

10. Essential Consideration and Indivisibility. You acknowledge that Your agreement to the restrictions in Section 4 (Conditions on Information Sovereignty) constitutes the sole and material consideration provided by You in exchange for the rights granted under this License.

If any portion of Section 4 is held to be unenforceable, invalid, or unconscionable by a court of competent jurisdiction: (a) This entire License is void ab initio (from the beginning) due to failure of consideration; (b) Your usage of the Work constitutes immediate and willful copyright infringement; and (c) Licensor reserves the right to seek statutory damages for said infringement, solely for the purpose of funding the enforcement of the Principles of Information Sovereignty.

11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

11.1 Choice of Law. This License shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business ("Licensor's Jurisdiction"), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

11.2 Venue. Any dispute arising from this License shall be adjudicated in the courts located within [ INSERT JURISDICTION HERE, e.g., King County, Washington ]. If no jurisdiction is specified in the Copyright Notice or attached NOTICE file, venue shall default to the federal or state courts located in the district where the Licensor resides.

11.3 Interpretation of Purpose. The Court is instructed to interpret this License with the understanding that the Licensor’s primary intent is the prevention of censorship and surveillance, not commercial gain. Ambiguities should be resolved in favor of preserving the integrity of the Information Sovereignty conditions set forth in Section 4.
